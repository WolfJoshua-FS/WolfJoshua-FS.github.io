<h1 class="center" align="center">About Us</h1>
<p class="center">
    &emsp; RAZA started with the intent of reaching the many Central and South American United States military veterans who continue to keep their warrior mindset. We have all served in one form or another, fighting or supporting those fighting in our decades long war. We hail from the Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps. Some regulars and some from SOC, we all are here to celebrate our heritage in the culture of warriors.</p>

<p align="center">
    <em>Una vez un guerrero, Siempre un guerrero.</em> </br>It's in our blood.
